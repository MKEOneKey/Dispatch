 * Return a [CoroutineScope] bound to this point in the composition using the optional
 * [CoroutineContext] provided by [getContext]. [getContext] will only be called once and the same
 * [CoroutineScope] instance will be returned across recompositions.
 *
 * This scope will be [cancelled][CoroutineScope.cancel] when this call leaves the composition.
 * The [CoroutineContext] returned by [getContext] may not contain a [Job] as this scope is
 * considered to be a child of the composition.
 *
 * The default dispatcher of this scope if one is not provided by the context returned by
 * [getContext] will be the applying dispatcher of the composition's [Recomposer].
 *
 * Use this scope to launch jobs in response to callback events such as clicks or other user
 * interaction where the response to that event needs to unfold over time and be cancelled if the
 * composable managing that process leaves the composition. Jobs should never be launched into
 * **any** coroutine scope as a side effect of composition itself. For scoped ongoing jobs
 * initiated by composition, see [LaunchedEffect].
 *
 * This function will not throw if preconditions are not met, as composable functions do not yet
 * fully support exceptions. Instead the returned scope's [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] will
 * contain a failed [Job] with the associated exception and will not be capable of launching
 * child jobs.
